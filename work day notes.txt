m0.
So payouts. Today if I succeed then I should payout 10B. I failed last time because of something outside of my control.
Payout for succeed at resto with tall if she is there is about 50B. And about 10B with the one wt shrt hair.

17/8
m0 Nervous and don't want to do it. But I will try... Fuck. I don't really have any hobbies I enjoy. The problem with Thai
is that it is hard to pronounce things properly.

Wow m so low and miserable...

After having coffee. Too busy. M5. Bleh. Very temp...

Back to m0. Ble.

Wager for this week (End date Sunday). Wager is ... 10 pts.

14/8/
M0. Today is the day of reckoning 1000 points. 

M10 and +1000. I did it. Made some mistakes probably because was nervous. But body language, smile and talking all positive....

13/8
Really close to saying this stuff correctly. M3 after Su audio. What I need now is bonus 5000 ask Thai waitress goddess 
for language exchange or tutoring for money.

Now back to m0. Man talking to Thai wait will be suicide if I ask for language exchange. It's failed twice already...

12/8
M0 as expected. Maybe I increase Friday payoff to 1000 if it isn't already.

11/8
m0..... as expected. FUCK. After work do what...Walk around the city?

What other ideas for a game. Things that effect SE. Points. >?

Another idea. Squeeze. P events don't happen often. Maybe I get better at squeezing every drop of p from a tiny insignificant event.... Measurement can be in Xcel.. Event date. pts per day. Then eventually run out...

Today smile ... 

10/8
I have an idea. Investments versus payoff but this time with people. So A for example very high investment. Slight positive return. Dew. Solid investment. Extremely negative return. Thai waitress. Some positive investment. Slightly negative return.


Very depressed. I'm not really making much progress. I can easily make friends online but not irl.

3/8
Forgot my glasses again. Might try luck with A today.

Immediate smile: Positive
Talk: Positive:
Body positioning: Unknown (slightly positive or neutral) 

I said mee almond milk le bplaoo and she answered in Thai. When alone with her I just talked English and asked
How come you call me Josh. She looked down and smiled... not sure what to make of it.


Want to add to mtg debt:
Speaking Thai with other language exchange partners. 1 point for 1 person... It might make me braver.

31/7
