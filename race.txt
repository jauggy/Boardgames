So idea for game. Three players equal turns.
Josh 1 progress: 7 pts
Josh 2 progress: 1 pts
Josh 3 progress: 2 pts

So player 1 will score based on the next Josh that progresses. Then player 2. Last round when someone hits 20 points.
I think that Josh 2 should be 1 pt banked. So he would only get it next time he score a 2 pointer or 7 pointer. Hmm. Might be too complicated. Maybe just make it that it counts as 0 if on score 19.
